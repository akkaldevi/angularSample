##Troubleshooting

During installation depending on your os and prerequisite versions you may encounter some issues. Most issues can be solved by one of the following tips:

####Update NPM, Bower or Gulp
Sometimes you may find there is a weird error during install like npmâ€™s Error: ENOENT. Usually updating those tools to the latest version solves the issue.

1. **$ npm update -g npm**        (Updating NPM)
2. **$ npm update -g gulp**       (Updating Gulp)
3. **$ npm update -g bower**      (Updating Bower)

####Cleaning NPM and Bower cache
NPM and Bower has a caching system for holding packages that you already installed. We found that often cleaning the cache solves some troubles this system creates.

1. **$ npm cache clean**    (NPM Clean Cache)
2. **$ bower cache clean**  (Bower Clean Cache)
